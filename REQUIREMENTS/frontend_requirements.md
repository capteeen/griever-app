# GRIEVER App Frontend Requirements

## Overview

GRIEVER is an AI-powered competition platform where users submit sad stories to compete for cryptocurrency rewards. An AI agent evaluates each story's emotional impact and responds via voice with either encouragement (for compelling stories) or dark humor (for less impactful submissions).
